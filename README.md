# Delete ROI

## Delete ROI from image, ROI manager and Results table

This ImageJ macro allows the user to left mouse-click on a ROI name in the image. This will delete the ROI from the image, the ROI manager and the results table.
For this to work the results table has to be created using the Multi Measure option (deselect "One Row Per Slice") from the ROI Managers menu with "Display label" selected in Set Measurements (Analyze > Set Measurements).

## Download code

Select the file "DeleteSelected_ROI2.txt" and select "Raw" from the right side menu. Select all the code and copy and paste this into the text editor from ImageJ/Fiji (File > New > Text Window). Alternatively, you can download all files via the green "Code" button as a ZIP file and extract the macro file. Save this file in your macros sub-folder within the ImageJ or Fiji folder with the name DeleteSelected_ROI2.txt.
